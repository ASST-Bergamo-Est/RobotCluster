# Magnetic Module Adapter

Here you can find drawings of an adapter for 96-well micro plate to be used with the [Opentrons Magnetic Module](https://opentrons.com/modules/magnetic-module/).

## Why is this needed

This adapter serve for mainly two purpose:
1. to permit the use of unskirted plates with the module;
2. to ease the drop off of the plate with a robotic arm (without the adapter the drop off is difficult)

## 3D model

The 3D model has been developed with Fusion360 software.
