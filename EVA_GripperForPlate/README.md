# Gripper for EVA robot

Here you can find 3D model and STL files to produce fingers for a gripper mounted on the EVA robot.

## Why is this needed

We need this to move plates.
Fingers are designed to be used with ANSI/SLAS plates, gripped on the short side.

## Gripper

Fingers are designed to be used with gripper equipped on the EVA: Zimmer GEP-2006IO-00-B-03 


## 3D model

The 3D model has been developed with Fusion360 software; 
The model has to be printed in two parts:
1. the main gripper, printed in hard plastic (we used PETG);
2. two rubbery pad that has to be glued on the main gripper, to increase friction picking up plates (we used TPU95 for that).
For both of the part an STL model is provided.
